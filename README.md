# Welcome to Node.js Gabriel's Sandbox!

This is the stuff I'm using here (I will update this section whenever I start to use/study a new module):

- node.js (v0.12.0)
- npm (v2.5.1)
- express (v4.12.0)
- mongoDB (v2.6.8)
- Mongoose (v3.8.24)
 
I've used this content as reference to build what you see here:

- this [Youtube serie] : Although the author has never finished it, it can give you a good idea of how it works.
- this [Youtube video] : Explains what is express and shows how it works, is a good introduction for express.
- this [Node.js tutorial]: It introduces mongoDB and is a good way to put in practice all the concepts.
- The [Mongoose QuickStart] Guide: It introduces Mongoose in general.
- This [GitHub Repo]: It shows how to implement mongoose in express, it's REALLY old, but I could manage to adapt it to the current version of express (really helpful).

If you want to see some more of my work, you can always visit my [portfolio].
